Hi, my name is Zeren Li. Last night, I had my first bio exam. Though I prepared well for it, I was suprised lot of qustions I have not seen before. As it turns out, I have to study harder for my bio in the future study.
In order to study better, I've chosen an unorthodox method.
I stand on my head and breathe like a fighter pilot.
It's worked well for me so far.
