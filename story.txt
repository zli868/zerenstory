Hi, my name is Zeren Li. Last night, I had my first bio exam. Though I prepared well for it, I was suprised lot of qustions I have not seen before. As it turns out, I have to study harder for my bio in the future study.
In order to study better, I've chosen an unorthodox method.
I stand on my head and breathe like a fighter pilot.
It's worked well for me so far. 
Even though bio is hard, studying for it is important.
Studying is important in general as it implants the concepts of the class into your brain.

I am developing a new studying method to cope with bio. I cannot go into detail for legal reasons but it basically works by uploading a pdf of the textbook directly into my brain via bluetooth.
